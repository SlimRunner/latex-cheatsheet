\subsection{Miscellaneous Tips}
\footnotesize
\blockquote{A DNS server using UDP will query a different authoritative
server if its first query is lost (assuming there are multiple
authoritative servers). It attempts to maximize hit probability.}

\blockquote{A TCP handshake takes 1 RTT}

\blockquote{\textbf{Fast retransmission} requires 3 packets losses to be
triggered, and it halves the cwnd. \textbf{Slow retransmission} waits
for the recovery timer to expire and resets the cwnd}

\blockquote{\textbf{Stub resolver} must know the IP address of a caching
resolver. These are usually are the end users.}

\blockquote{\textbf{Cache resolvers} must know the IP address of a root
server.}

\blockquote{\textbf{Authoritative server} the final source of truth
(either address or CNAME).}

\blockquote{Do not bundle last (optional) ACK and FIN.}

For client call:

  \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-0.5em]
    \item \codebox{socket}
    \item \codebox{recvfrom} and \codebox{sendto} to receive and send data.

For server call:
\begin{footnotesize}
  \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-0.5em]
    \item \codebox{socket}
    \item \codebox{bind} to an address to use
    \item \codebox{recvfrom} and \codebox{sendto} to receive and send data.

\subsection{HTTP/1.0}
It uses TCP. Allows 1 request per connection. Each request needs to
reopen a connection. Allows parallel connections. Does not allow
pipelining. Server initiates FIN.
\subsection{HTTP/1.1}
It uses TCP. Connection is persistent. As many requests per connection.
Allows pipelining and parallel connections.
\subsection{HTTP/2.0}
Similar to HTTP/1.1 but it brakes down large packets into frames. This
allows to prevent some forms of head-of-line blocking (cannot prevent
inherent TCP HoL blocking). It also allows to send multiple streams of
data for multiplexing.
\subsection{HTTP Packet Types}
\resizebox{5cm}{!}{
  \begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l|l|l|l|l| }
    \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Type} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{HTTP/1.0} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{HTTP/1.1} \\
    \hline
    GET    & yes      & yes \\
    \hline
    POST   & yes      & yes \\
    \hline
    HEAD   & yes      & yes \\
    \hline
    PUT    & no       & yes \\
    \hline
    DELETE & no       & yes \\

\subsection{TCP + TLS}
\begin{center}

\end{center}
\subsection{Stop-and-Wait}
Exactly, that. Stops and waits for the ACK to return before sending the
next packet.
\subsection{Go-Back-N}
Sender has sliding window and can send many unacknowledged packets.
Acknowledgement is for the latest received packet w/o error and sender
window slides. On packet loss it retransmits all packets in the sliding
window. ACKs are cumulative. It does not buffers packets.
\subsection{Selective Repeat}
Sender has sliding window and can send many unacknowledged packets.
Receiver acknowledges each received packet, and it buffers them
(out-of-order if necessary). Sender ``selects'' ACKed packets and
re-sends unACKed ones when their individual timers expire.
\subsection{QUIC}
QUIC does not retransmit a lost packet. Instead it sends it as a later
packet. A QUIC connection has multiple streams which carry frames that
can have multiple types. A frame cannot exeed a packet max size since
they are bundled in a UDP packet.
\subsection{Network Layer}
Uses IP packets. \textbf{Forwarding:} move packets from a router's input
link to appropriate router output link. Trip analogy: process of getting
through single interchange. Data plane, local. \textbf{Routing:}
determine route taken by packets from source to destination. Trip
analogy: process of planning trip from source to destination. Control
plane, network-wide. IP packets have TTL which prevents them from
staying forever in a network (measured in remaining hops).
\subsection{IP Packet Fragmentation}
IP packets are prone to framentation. MTU is used to limite the size of
packets. Packets are only reassembled at destination.
\begin{center}
  \resizebox{5cm}{!}{
  \includegraphics[]{images/ip-frag.png}
  }
\end{center}
Identifier: generated by the sending host. It identifies all the
segments in the same IP packet and stays unchanged when refragmented.

For flags bit 0 (left most) is reserved, bit 1 (DF bit) prevents
fragmentation if set (dropped if it does not fit), and bit 2 (MF bit)
helps determine the last fragment of a packet (and only the last).

Fragment offset counts from the first byte in the original payload count
in units of 8-byte blocks.
