\section{Building Blocks \& Dimensions}
These are some traits that makes a prog. language distinct:
\begin{itemize}
  \item type systems
  \item parameter passing
  \item scoping
  \item memory management
\end{itemize}
Some other considerations are
\begin{itemize}
  \item variable declaration/assignment
  \item rules for implicit conversions
  \item container bound checks
\end{itemize}
Finally, all of these can be categorized into:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{syntax}: legal ways to write code in the language. This
  is to code what grammar is to human language.
  \item \textbf{semantics}: \textit{meaningful} was to write code in the
  langauge. A sentence in English may be correct, but does it make
  sense?
\end{itemize}
