\section{Python}
Everything on Python are objects. Variables hold a mutable reference to
an object. All objects live in the heap. All primitive types are
immutable objects. Python uses referece count to garbage collect.
Arguments are passed by object reference.

Deepcopy is useful to make copies of complex user defined objects, and it
can handle circular references.

Python multithreading is limited by the garbage collection which puts a
lock on objects that essentially results in what seems like single
threaded async calls.
