\section{Python}
Everything on Python are objects. Variables hold a reference to an
object. All objects live on the heap. All primitive types are immutable
objects. None is a singleton. Python uses referece count to garbage
collect. Arguments are passed by object reference.

Deepcopy is useful to make copies of complex user defined objects, and it
can handle circular references.
