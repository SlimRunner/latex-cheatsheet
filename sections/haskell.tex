\section{Haskell}
Haskell is a functional programming language where all variables are
immutable and all functions are pure (first class). IO is possible but
requires special handling since an IO call cannot be a pure function.

Evaluation of variables in Haskell is lazy (need semantics) which is
more optimal with cache because of their immutability. Its Boolean
expressions shortcircuit.

Haskell has automatic type inference, but it is an statically typed
language.
