\section{Scoping}
The scope is the sections of the program where a variable is valid
during its lifetime.

\subsection*{Lexical Scoping}
It uses lexical environments to set boundaries for the scope of
variables. Functions have disjoint lexical environments while blocks
such as if-statement, for-loop, etc. have nested lexical environments.
Nested environments allow shadowing.

\subsection*{Dynamic Scoping}
It uses chronological order of definition to create scopes. It
disregards lexical scopes jump between disjoint lexical environments. It
also supports shadowing.
