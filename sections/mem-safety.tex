\section{Memory Safety}
Memory safety is a key property of strongly-typed languages. In short,
memory safe languages prevent any memory operations that could lead to
undefined behaviour. Considerations are
\begin{itemize}
  \item out-of-bound array indexes and unconstrained pointer arithmetic
  \item casting values to incompatible types
  \item use of uninitialized variables and pointers
  \item use of dangling pointers to dead objects (use-after-free, double-free, â€¦)
\end{itemize}
