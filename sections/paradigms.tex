\section{Paradigms}
\subsection*{Imperative Langs}
They are based on statements that define the control flow. Most
languages are imperative.
\subsection*{Object-Oriented Langs}
They are based on class and objects that send messages to each other
through method calls. Each class exposes a minimal interface and hides
the rest. These are rarely standalone. Most are built on top of
another paradigm.
\subsection*{Functional Langs}
They are based on functions in a more mathematical sense. They lack
loops. Instead they must rely on recursion. An example os this is
Haskell and OCaml.
\subsection*{Logic Langs}
They are based on facts and rules. They are uncommon. An example is
Prolog.
